Program for F0 Extraction in STRAIGHT Analysis
* FOR LITTLE ENDIAN

usage: tempo [options...] [inputfile] [outputfile]
options:
        -uf0 upperf0[800.0]             : f0 upper limit [Hz]
        -lf0 lowerf0[40.0]              : f0 lower limit [Hz]
        -f samp_freq[16000.0]           : sampling frequency [Hz]
        -shift shift[1.0]               : frame shift [ms], (<= 5 ms)
        -f0shift f0shift[5.0]           : f0 frame shift [ms]
        -cf0file cf0file                : candidate f0 file
        -fast                           : fast version
        -raw                            : input raw file (16bit short)
        -nmsg                           : no message
        -help                           : display this message

Input file is a wav file (RIFF WAVE). If input file is a raw file,
use -raw and determine sampling frequency by -f.

Output file is a text file describing F0s [Hz]. A range of F0s is
determined by -uf0 and -lf0. If an input file includes some noises,
e.g., an AC component, you need to set -lf0 and -uf0 to appropriate
values. A shift length of output F0s is determined by -f0shift.

Some messages are printed while executing this program. If you
don't need those messages, use -nmsg.

In order to reduce the computational cost, some processes can
be removed by -fast.
* Note that this option causes the degradation of estimation accuracy.

If you would like to correct the F0s by hand, you can select
the other candidates of F0s. A candidate F0 file is generated
by -cf0file. An example of this file is as follows:
   # FrameShift=10
   0.0 100.0 79.6 76.0 42.2 46.4 254.0 0.0 
   0.0 100.0 44.4 53.1 267.3 49.5 92.1 44.7 
   136.3 93.5 58.6 27.9 
   127.1 87.1 57.1 64.6 223.0 50.9 
The odd columns show candidates of F0s. The 1st columns show
the best F0s. The even columns show confidence values but these
values are not reliable... For example, in the following line,
   127.1 87.1 57.1 64.6 223.0 50.9 
the best F0 value is 127.1 Hz, the 2nd candidate F0 is 57.1 Hz,
and the 3rd candidate F0 is 223.0 Hz.


<EXAMPLE>
% tempo \
	-uf0 400 \
	-lf0 70 \
        -f0shift 10.0 \
        -cf0file output.cf0 \
	-fast \
        -nmsg \
	input.wav \
	output.f0
