Program for Calculation of Dynamic Feature
* FOR LITTLE ENDIAN

usage: delta [options...] [infile] [outfile]
options:
        -dim dim[24]                    : dimension
        -dynwinf dynwinf                : window file for dynamic feature
        -jnt                            : output joint matrix
        -nmsg                           : no message
        -help                           : display this message

The input file is a binary file of static feature vectors. The output
file is a binary file of dynamic feature vectors. The number of
dimensions of the feature vector is changed by -dim.

A binary file of a delta window is necessary and it is used by -dynwinf.

If -jnt is used, the output file is joint features constructed by
concatenating static and dynamic features.

Binary data has double-type format.

Some messages are printed while executing this program. If you
don't need those messages, use -nmsg.


<EXAMPLE>
% delta \
	-dim 20 \
	-dynwinf input.win \
	-jnt \
	-nmsg \
	intput.svecs \
	output.sdvecs
